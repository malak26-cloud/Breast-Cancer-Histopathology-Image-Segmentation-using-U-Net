# Histopathological Image Segmentation for Accurate Cancer Detection

## Introduction
This project focuses on the segmentation of breast cancer histopathology images using the U-Net architecture, a widely recognized model in the field of biomedical image analysis. Accurate segmentation of these images is crucial for identifying and localizing cancerous cells, ultimately aiding pathologists in making more informed diagnoses and treatment decisions.

Histopathological images are complex and often contain subtle differences between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue, making manual analysis time-consuming and prone to human error. By employing deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like U-Net, this project aims to automate the segmentation process, enhancing both precision and efficiency.

The U-Net model is specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks, featuring an encoder-decoder structure that captures context and enables precise localization. Through this project, we aim to leverage the power of deep learning to contribute to the field of medical diagnostics, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

In addition to model implementation, the project includes comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess model performance, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the domain of medical image analysis.


## U-Net Architecture
The U-Net architecture is a powerful convolutional neural network designed specifically for image segmentation tasks, particularly in biomedical applications. Its unique structure enables precise localization and context capture, making it ideal for segmenting breast cancer histopathology images.

### Architecture Overview
The U-Net architecture consists of two main components: the **contracting path** (encoder) and the **expanding path** (decoder). 

1. **Contracting Path (Encoder):**
   - The encoder progressively captures high-level features of the input image through a series of convolutional and max-pooling layers.
   - Each convolutional block consists of two 3x3 convolutional layers followed by a ReLU activation function, effectively extracting features while maintaining spatial hierarchies.
   - After each block, max pooling (2x2) is applied to downsample the feature maps, allowing the network to learn increasingly abstract representations.
   - This path reduces the spatial dimensions while increasing the number of feature channels, effectively capturing context about the image.

2. **Bottleneck:**
   - At the bottom of the U, a bottleneck layer connects the contracting and expanding paths. This layer further processes the feature maps before transitioning to the decoder, allowing for a more sophisticated representation of the image features.

3. **Expanding Path (Decoder):**
   - The decoder up-samples the feature maps using transposed convolutions, effectively reconstructing the spatial dimensions of the input image.
   - Each upsampling step is followed by a concatenation with the corresponding feature maps from the encoder. This skip connection preserves spatial information lost during downsampling, enhancing localization accuracy.
   - The decoder consists of convolutional blocks that refine the feature maps, enabling the model to make precise predictions about the segmentation.

4. **Output Layer:**
   - The final layer uses a 1x1 convolution to produce the output segmentation map, where each pixel corresponds to a class label (e.g., cancerous or non-cancerous tissue).

### Project Application
In this project, the U-Net architecture is employed to segment breast cancer histopathology images, allowing for the identification and localization of cancerous regions. By leveraging the model's ability to capture both global context and local details, we aim to enhance the accuracy of cancer detection, ultimately contributing to improved diagnostic processes in pathology.

# Usage
## Installation
To begin this project, use the included `Makefile`

#### Creating Virtual Environment

This package is built using `python-3.8`. 
We recommend creating a virtual environment and using a matching version to ensure compatibility.

#### pre-commit

`pre-commit` will automatically format and lint your code. You can install using this by using
`make use-pre-commit`. It will take effect on your next `git commit`

#### pip-tools

The method of managing dependencies in this package is using `pip-tools`. To begin, run `make use-pip-tools` to install. 

Then when adding a new package requirement, update the `requirements.in` file with 
the package name. You can include a specific version if desired but it is not necessary. 

To install and use the new dependency you can run `make deps-install` or equivalently `make`

If you have other packages installed in the environment that are no longer needed, you can you `make deps-sync` to ensure that your current development environment matches the `requirements` files.
